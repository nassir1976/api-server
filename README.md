# Phase 3 Requirements
- Build a REST API using Express, by creating a proper series of endpoints that perform CRUD operations on a Mongo Database, using the REST standard

## Data Models

- Create 2 Mongo data models using Mongoose, exported as Node Modules
- Create a Collection Class that accepts a Mongoose Model into the constructor and assigns it as this.model
- This class should have the following methods defined, to perform CRUD Operations
- Each method should in turn call the appropriate Mongoose method for the model
- create()
- get() or read()
- update()
- delete()


## Routes
In your express server, create a router module for each data model that youâ€™ve created. Within the router module, create REST route handlers for each of the REST Methods that properly calls the correct CRUD method from the matching data model.

Add a Record

- CRUD Operation: Create
- REST Method: POST
- Path: /food
- Input: JSON Object in the Request Body
- Returns: The record that was added to the database.
- You must generate an ID and attach it to the object
- You should verify that only the fields you define get saved as a record

Get All Records

- CRUD Operation: Read
- REST Method: GET
- Path: /food
- Returns: An array of objects, each object being one entry from your database

Get One Record

- CRUD Operation: Read
- REST Method: GET
- Path: /food/1
- Returns: The object from the database, which has the id matching that which is in the path
- Update A Record
- CRUD Operation: Update
- REST Method: PUT
- Path: /food/1
- Input: JSON Object in the Request Body
- Returns: The object from the database, which has the id matching that which is in the path, with the updated/

changed data

- You should verify that only the fields you define get saved as a record
- Delete A Record
- CRUD Operation: Destroy
- REST Method: DELETE
- Path: /food/1
- Returns: The record from the database as it exists after you delete it (i.e. null)
